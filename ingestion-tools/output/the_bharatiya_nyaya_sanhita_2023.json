A, intending to rob Z, seizes the pole and stops the\npalanquin. Here A has caused cessation of motion to Z, and he has done this by his own\nbodily power.

A has used criminal force to Z.\n(d) A intentionally pushes against Z in the street. Here A has by his own bodily power\nmoved his own person so as to bring it into contact with Z. He has therefore intentionally\nused force to Z; and if he has done so without Z’s consent, intending or knowing it to be\nlikely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal force to Z.\n(e) A throws a stone, intending or knowing it to be likely that the stone will be thus\nbrought into contact with Z, or with Z’s clothes, or with something carried by Z, or that it will\nstrike water and dash up the water against Z’s clothes or something carried by Z. Here, if the\nthrowing of the stone produce the effect of causing any substance to come into contact with\nZ, or Z’s clothes, A has used force to Z, and if he did so without Z’s consent, intending\nthereby to injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal force to Z.\n(f) A intentionally pulls up a woman’s veil. Here A intentionally uses force to her, and if.\nhe does so without her consent intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby\ninjure, frighten or annoy her, he has used criminal force to her.\n(g) Z is bathing. A pours into the bath water which he knows to be boiling. Here A\nintentionally by his own bodily power causes such motion in the boiling water as brings that\nwater into contact with Z, or with other water so situated that such contact must affect Z’s\nsense of feeling; A has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done this\nwithout Z’s consent intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause injury,\nfear or annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force.\n(A) A incites a dog to spring upon Z, without Z’s consent. Here, if A intends to cause\ninjury, fear or annoyance to Z, he uses criminal force to Z.",
